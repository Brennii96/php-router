            I am an enthusiastic individual, who possesses the flexibility to adapt to differing scenarios that I may be faced with. I am strong at administrative tasks and have the technical ability to succeed in tasks always giving 100%. IT literate. In my last
            role I learnt and converted PHP to Laravel and developed on WordPress for the front end websites. I am currently looking for an IT role to continue learning software and web development.

            <article class="job-summary">
                I developed a new Wordpress theme for our main website as we were going for a rebrand and wanted the new sites to be fully responsive and work on the most popular devices. This included using Google Analytics to see what devices are most used across our current sites and targeting them.<br>
                I also set up a few reports for our office users to be used to find information. This was of course using Laravel for populating the data for the reports and blade templating for displaying them. Since I was using blade it made it easy to style them and use the same format across all reports for easy use. <br>
                I spent most of my time converting vanilla PHP code over to the Laravel framework. For example, we had emails being sent using PHP mail so I went through and set them all up to be sent using Laravel Mailables. Sending them using Mailables made them easier to manage and style since they would be made using blade templating rather than plain text. The Mailables were stored in a MySQL database so we could perform an API call from our other sites to use them.<br>
                I developed API endpoints to be used on our frontend sites. This meant I needed to use jQuery to perform a POST request to our Laravel API endpoints and return the results to the end user.

                I setup and provided technical support for all IT and networking equipment in the office. This included setting up the servers and all staff PCs and electricians mobiles. <br>
                I developed the company website from scratch and handled the SEO and server. I was given text and some images to get a design for the website then build and publish it. <br>
                I setup the office Windows server and Ubuntu server. The Windows server was used mainly as a file server and for managing file access. I set the Ubuntu sever as a LAMP server to be used with Nextcloud so the electricians could share images of jobs. This also allowed staff to share large amounts of files with clients.

<article class="job-summary">I currently develop websites and application in my free time using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I I have setup my own cloud storage using a raspberry pi which I can access anywhere in the world.
    I also enjoy learning Kenpo Karate, because I like to know how to defend myself and it’s a great form of physical and mental exercise. I am now a black belt in Kenpo Karate and like to train in my free time to ensure I don’t forget anything.
    In my free time, I am learning more about PHP and MySQL to build more reliable applications and offer advice to friends or family about building websites. </article>
